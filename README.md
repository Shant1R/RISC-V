# RISC-V based MYTH Workshop

This repository summaries the task and flow under the RISC-V workshop hosted by Kunal Ghosh of VSD Corp. Pvt. Ltd. 


## DAY 1 - Introduction to RISC-V ISA and GNU Compiler Toolchain

<details>
<summary><strong>Tools Installation</strong></summary>

Under this section, we go over the necessary tool installations for RISC-V based MYTH workshop. The system used is Zorin OS 16.3, and kernel version - 5.15.0-50-generic.

- Follow the steps.

```bash
sudo apt install libboost-all-dev
git clone https://github.com/kunalg123/riscv_workshop_collaterals.git
cd riscv_workshop_collaterals
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

- Once run, a make error occurs. It is ignored and and the following commands are given

 ```bash
cd ~/riscv_toolchain/iverilog/
git checkout --track -b v10-branch origin/v10-branch
git pull 
chmod 777 autoconf.sh 
./autoconf.sh 
./configure 
make
sudo make install
```


- Now set the PATH variable in .bashrc file

```bash
gedit .bashrchttps://vsdiat.com/home
#Instead of shant put your username
export PATH="/home/shant/riscv_toolchain/riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc-8.3.0-2019.08.0-x86_64-linux-ubuntu14/bin:$PATH" 
source .bashrc

```
